$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \cdots + \beta_n X_n + \epsilon$$

with $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.

However, this model assumes that the height differences between males and females observed in the general population from 2009-2011 remain stable and representative of future military recruits, which may not hold if recruitment patterns or population characteristics have changed over time.

$$\hat{\text{height}} = 162.18 + 15.94 \cdot \text{sexMale}$$

fit_height <- linear_reg() |> 
 fit(height ~ sex, data = x)

  kable(
    caption = "Estimates and 95% Confidence Intervals for Parameters\nSource: NHANES 2009â€“2011"
  )
```

We model height, measured in centimeters, as a linear function of sex. This linear regression approach allows us to estimate the average height difference between male and female individuals in our population of interest.
