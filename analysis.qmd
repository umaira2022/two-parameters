$$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \cdots + \beta_n X_n + \epsilon$$

with $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.

However, this model assumes that the height differences between males and females observed in the general population from 2009-2011 remain stable and representative of future military recruits, which may not hold if recruitment patterns or population characteristics have changed over time.
